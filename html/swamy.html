          <dt>Introduction:</dt>
          <dd>Swami Vivekananda, known in his pre-monastic life as Narendra Nath Datta, was born in an affluent family in Kolkata on 12 January 1863. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was a successful attorney with interests in a wide range of subjects, and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, was endowed with deep devotion, strong character and other qualities. A precocious boy, Narendra excelled in music, gymnastics and studies. By the time he graduated from Calcutta University, he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects, especially Western philosophy and history. Born with a yogic temperament, he used to practise meditation even from his boyhood, and was associated with Brahmo Movement for some time.</dd>
          <dt> Education:</dt>
          <dd>At the age of eight, Swami Vivekananda joined at the Metropolitan Institution of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, where he attended school until his family relocated to Raipur in 1877.
            Swami Vivekananda was the sole student to achieve first-division marks on the Presidency College admission exam in 1879, following the relocation of his family to Calcutta.
            At the General Assembly’s Institution, Swami Vivekananda studied Western logic, Western philosophy, and European history (now known as the Scottish Church College).
            Swami Vivekananda passed the Fine Arts test in 1881, and in 1884 he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill, and Charles Darwin were among the authors Narendra examined.
            Herbert Spencer’s theory of evolution captivated him, and through correspondence, he translated his book Education (1861) into Bengali. Swami Vivekananda studied Bengali literature and Sanskrit scriptures in addition to Western philosophers.</dd>
          <dt> Swami Vivekananda Jayanti:</dt>
          <dd>Every year, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is observed to remember one of India’s finest teachers’ birth. On January 12, 1863, Swami Vivekananda was born. Swami Vivekananda followed Swami Ramkrishna Paramhansa and eventually became a “sanyasi” or monk. Due to the renowned teacher’s faith in the nation’s youth, Swami Vivekananda’s birthday is also observed as National Youth Day.</dd>
          <dt>Swami Vivekanand's meeting with Sri Ramakrishna:</dt>        
          <dd>When Narendra was on the cusp of becoming a young adult, he went through a difficult moment of spiritual crisis during which he questioned God’s existence. One of his college English instructors was the first person he heard about Sri Ramakrishna from. In November 1881, Narendra visited the Kali Temple in Dakshineswar, where Sri Ramakrishna was residing. He wasted no time asking the Master, “Sir, have you seen God?”—a query he’d previously posed to numerous others with little success. Sri Ramakrishna said confidently, “Yes, I have. If anything, my perception of Him is clearer than my perception of you.

            Sri Ramakrishna not only dispelled Narendra’s scepticism but also won him over with the selflessness of his love. It is marked as the beginning of a rare kind of guru-disciple connection in the annals of enlightened teachers. Once Narendra began making regular trips to Dakshineswar, he advanced quickly in his spiritual development at the hands of the Master. They all became good friends when Narendra met numerous young guys in Dakshineswar who were committed to Sri Ramakrishna.</dd>
            <dt>Formation of Ramakrishna Mission:</dt>
            <dd>He returned to India in about 1897 and arrived in Calcutta, where he launched Ramakrishna Mission on May 1st, 1897, at Belur Math. The mission’s ideals were founded on Karma Yoga, whose principal purpose was to aid the country’s impoverished, suffering, or troubled populace. This goal includes establishing schools, universities, and hospitals, among other social services. Vedanta teachings were disseminated nationwide via seminars, conferences, workshops, and rehabilitation work.              Vivekananda’s teachings were primarily founded on Ramakrishna’s spiritual teachings of Divine manifestations and his internalisation of the Advaita Vedanta Philosophy. According to him, the ultimate objective of life is to acquire spiritual liberation, which embraces one’s complete faith.</dd>
          <dt>Death:</dt>
          <dd>He anticipated that he would die before the age of 40. As a result, he died while meditating on July 4th, 1902. He is reported to have reached ‘Mahasamadhi’ and was cremated on the Ganga’s banks.

            Swami Vivekananda’s teachings inspired not just the young but the whole globe. He established the true foundations of India’s national unity. He showed us how to coexist with so many differences. He was effective in building a virtual bridge between Eastern and Western cultures. He was instrumental in separating Indian culture from the world at large.
